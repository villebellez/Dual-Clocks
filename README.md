<h2>Project One for CS-210 at Southern New Hampshire University</h2>

________

<i>"Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock."
</i><br>

<b>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</b>
1. The 12-Hour clock should be displayed in 12-hour format with AM/PM where the clock does not exceed 12:59:59.
2. The 24-Hour clock should be displayed in 24-hour format where the clock does not exceed 23:59:59.
3. Both clocks should display on the screen with the current time in the proper format.
4. Your solution should allow the user to exit the program as well as add one hour, minute, or second to both clocks from a user menu.
5. Once a selection is made from the user menu, the program should take action based on that choice. Both clocks must display on the screen simultaneously in the proper format next to each other.
6. Your code should be properly modularized and written in functions so that your main() has the least amount of code.
7. You must demonstrate industry standard best practices in all your code to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency. This includes inserting in-line comments to denote your changes and to briefly describe the functionality of the code and using appropriate variable, parameter, and other naming conventions throughout your code.
